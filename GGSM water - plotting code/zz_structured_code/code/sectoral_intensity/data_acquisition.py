    Description:
        * Obtaining the global data
        * Water withdrawal data obtained from aquastat is provided in the form of countrywise tables with five period. This information is aggregated and global withdrawal data is generated.
        * During aggregation, the missing data values are filled by averaging method.
        * The water data is available consistently from 1970 onwards. Hence, backward extrapolation is carried out to estimate the data till year 1955.
    * Splitting the water withdrawal
        * Water withdrawal data for agricultural sector covers agriculture as well as livestocks. Similarly, the industrial water withdrawal data covers industries as well as power generation. Hence, these withdrawal numbers are split based on their contribution. 
        * Water withdrawal by agriculture is split into two parts in ratio 8:1 :: farming:livestock. *(Reference: Hoekstra, Arjen Y. "The water footprint of industry." Assessing and measuring environmental impact and sustainability. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2015. 221-254. â‡’ 1996 to 2005)*
        * Water withdrawal by industy is split into two parts in ratio 3:5 :: IS:EE. *(Reference: Mekonnen, Mesfin M., P. W. Gerbens-Leenes, and Arjen Y. Hoekstra. "The consumptive water footprint of electricity and heat: a global assessment." Environmental Science: Water Research & Technology 1.3 (2015): 285-297. Year 2000)*
    * The global water withdrawal data obtained thus has a period of 5 years, whereas the model has timestep of 1 week. Hence, this global data needs to be processed further.
