The directory structure of this module is as follows:

code - contains codes for various purposes
data - contains the data files, input and output both

code/plots - generating desired plots
code/config - config code
code/sectoral_intensity - sectoral intensity trends based on
                            the global water demand and GGSM state varibles
code/regional_distribution - regional distribution of the sectoral water demand
                                based on representative variables

data/input/scenarios - input files of various scenarios
data/input/state_variables - state variables data for validation
data/input/water/processed - water data processed
data/input/water/raw - representative variables data and continent list
data/output/dataframes - dataframes of intermediate steps and final solutions are saved here
data/output/plots - all the plots are saved here
