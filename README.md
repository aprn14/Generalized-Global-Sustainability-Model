This repository hosts the model code for the Generalized Global Sustainability Model(GGSM). 
The "GGSM MATLAB CODE" folder contains the main code for this model. 

The directory structure of the GGSM water-plotting code module is as follows:

code - contains codes for various purposes
data - contains the data files, input and output both

code/plots - generating desired plots
code/config - config code
code/sectoral_intensity - sectoral intensity trends based on
                            the global water demand and GGSM state varibles
code/regional_distribution - regional distribution of the sectoral water demand
                                based on representative variables

data/input/scenarios - input files of various scenarios
data/input/state_variables - state variables data for validation
data/input/water/processed - water data processed
data/input/water/raw - representative variables data and continent list
data/output/dataframes - dataframes of intermediate steps and final solutions are saved here
data/output/plots - all the plots are saved here
